# FABRIK Inverse Kinematics in Roblox

A simple module implementing FABRIK inverse kinematics in roblox. Not meant for usage, just as a fun little project. Nor is it very well-made. If you do need inverse kinematics (on Roblox), just use the IK Constraints. Either way this was fun to make. Made in 2023, not my best work. Enjoy!
